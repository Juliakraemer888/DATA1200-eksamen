        [Intro]
        A long, long time ago
        In a galaxy far away
        Naboo was under an attack
        And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
        Could talk the Federation into
        Maybe cutting them a little slack
        But their response, it didn't thrill us
        They locked the doors and tried to kill us
        We escaped from that gas
        Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass
        We took a bongo from the scene
        And we went to Theed to see the Queen
        We all wound up on Tatooine
        That's where we found this boy...
    </p>

        <p>
        [Chorus]
        Oh my, my, this here Anakin guy
        May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
        And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
        Sayin', "Soon, I'm gonna be a Jedi"
        "Soon, I'm gonna be a Jedi"
    </p>
