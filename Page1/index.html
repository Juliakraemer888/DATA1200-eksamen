            <h3> Tragic isn't it</h3>
            <p class="index-p">Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"? I thought not.<br>
                It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis<br>
                was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force<br>
                to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge <br>
                of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br>
                The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider <br>
                to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of<br>
                was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately,<br>
                he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him<br>
                in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
