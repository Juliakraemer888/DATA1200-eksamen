        <p>To test the accessibility in our website, we ran our site on an automated test called
             “Wave.webaim.org”. One of the errors we received were contrast errors, in term of low
              contrast between text and background colors. The error appeared since we use a lot of
               green and black elements in the navigation bar and footer section. We discussed if we
                should change the color from black to white to fix this error. By not changing the color,
                 it may be a problem for people with reduced vision or color blindness to see the content, 
                 but we have not tested this theory. We decided to keep the text as black in the headers and 
                 footers, since when testing the website on mobile devices, the content was clear for us, and 
                 we had no issue with seeing the navigation bar or footer section. We did however adjust the contrast 
                 scheme on the Rain Forest page by making the background a darker shade of green, and changing 
                 the text color to beige. By doing this, the content will apear clearer and more readable. 
        </p>
       <p>We also downscaled most of our images so they take less time to load into the website. This greatly improves
        performance. Here's the result of one of the performance tests, this one is specifically for the "Rain Forest" page;

       <p>While hovering over the nav-bar, we chose to have the nav text underlined while having a different 
        color to make it easy to see while navigating it, as shown here in the code;
        </p>

        <p>Here's one of the pages, ran through<cite>https://wave.webaim.org/</cite> showing one error that was
        fixed since it was a simple mistake and mostly constrast errors from the color contrasts in the nav and footer</p>

        <p>One of the most consistant problems we kept running into was pathing. If a picture doesn't load, check the pathing. 
            If the layout is suddenly very messed up, check the pathing. If all the colors are gone, you guessed it, pathing.
            By working in a group, we were easily able to overcome this problem simply by having extra pairs of eyes looking 
            for errors, typos, or mislabled addresses.
