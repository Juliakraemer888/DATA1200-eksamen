        <p>
        [Intro] <br>
        A long, long time ago
        In a galaxy far away
        Naboo was under an attack
        And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
        Could talk the Federation into
        Maybe cutting them a little slack <br>
        But their response, it didn't thrill us
        They locked the doors and tried to kill us
        We escaped from that gas
        Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass <br>
        We took a bongo from the scene
        And we went to Theed to see the Queen
        We all wound up on Tatooine
        That's where we found this boy...
     </p>
    
    <p>
        [Chorus] <br>
        Oh my, my, this here Anakin guy
        May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
        And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
        Sayin',  
        <br>"Soon, I'm gonna be a Jedi"
        "Soon, I'm gonna be a Jedi"
     </p>
    
     <p>
            [Verse 1] <br>
    Did you know this junkyard slave
    Isn't even old enough to shave?
    But he can use the Force, they say <br>
    Ah, do you see him hitting on the queen
    Though he's just nine and she's fourteen?
    Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday <br>
    Well, I know he built C-3PO
    And I've heard how fast his pod can go
    And we were broke, it's true
    So we made a wager or two <br>
    He was a prepubescent flyin' ace
    And the minute Jabba started off that race
    Well, I knew who would win first place
    Oh yes, it was our boy
</p>
    
<p>
    [Chorus] <br>
    We started singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
    May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
    And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
    Sayin', 
    <br>"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
    "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""
    </p>
    
    <p>
    [Verse 2] <br>
    Now we finally got to Coruscant
    The Jedi Council we knew would want
    To see how good the boy could be <br>
    So we took him there and we told the tale
    How his midichlorians were off the scale
    And he might fulfill that prophecy <br>
    Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
    Could he bring balance to the Force?
    They interviewed the kid
    Oh, training they forbid <br>
    Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
    And Qui-Gon said "Now listen here
    Just stick it in your pointy ear
    I still will teach this boy"
    </p>
    
    <p>
    [Chorus] <br>
    He was singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
    May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
    And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
    Sayin', 
    <br>"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
    "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
    </p>
    
    <p>
    [Bridge] <br>
    We caught a ride back to Naboo
    Cause Queen Amidala wanted to
    I frankly would've liked to stay <br>
    We all fought in that epic war
    And it wasn't long at all before
    Little hotshot flew his plane and saved the day <br>
    And in the end, some Gungans died
    Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
    A lot of folks were croakin'
    The battle droids were broken <br>
    And the Jedi I admire most
    Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
    Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost
    I guess I'll train this boy
    </p>
    
    <p>
    [Chorus] <br>
    And I was singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
    May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
    And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
    Sayin',
    <br>"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
    "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
    </p>
    
    <p>
    [Outro] <br>
    We were singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
    May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
    And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
    Sayin',
    <br>"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
     </p>
