    <h1>DATA1100 Technology and Society for programmers</h1>
    <p>Course description</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Digital competence is a key factor in ensuring the 
    employability of candidates in all professions vital 
    to our society. This course will provide a fundamental 
    understanding of our digital world. It gives an overview 
    of how technology affects our lives and the way we work, 
    as well as our social structures, work patterns and individual 
    preferences contributing to shaping technology. Social media, 
    digital governance, and eHealth are all examples of how technology 
    has profoundly changed our everyday lives in the last few decades. 
    An understanding of the benefits and limitations of technology is 
    vital in any profession, regardless of field or speciality. In this 
    course, students will acquire the basic knowledge required to harness 
    the potential of technology and recognise its limitations and potentially 
    harmful consequences on work and society. They will learn to identify 
    the opportunities to use technology to foster inclusion and participation 
    in an increasingly diverse and multicultural society. They will practice 
    communicating orally the concepts they acquire in a structured manner.</p>

    
    
    <h3>Teaching and learning methods</h3>
    <p>The course will utilize 'blended learning', with a combination of 
    attendance-based teaching or guidance, and use of online material. The 
    students will be working on interdisciplinary cases, and initiating and 
    performing a project within their field of study. The project will be 
    shaped by the student's and the field's own needs.</p>

    <h4>Course requirements</h4>
    <p>5 group submissions (Introduction week can be included as one of the 
    five work requirements)</p>
